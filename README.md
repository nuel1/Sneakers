## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

This project is an exciting piece i built that deeply expanded my knowledge of working with the DOM. It was super exiciting
as it really gave me the feel of how larger e-commerce projects are built.

At the end of this project i learnt how to:

- Build a slider and a model.
- Build a tab( navigation ).
- Work with browser local storage.
- Add and remove cart item from user cart.

### Continued development

Working with really large images was marjorly a thing i really couldn't do. Nevertheless, i hope to tackle
this deficiency by learning and understanding how to work with images of any size.
